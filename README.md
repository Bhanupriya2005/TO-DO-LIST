# TO-DO-LIST
this code creates a simple, responsive to-do list web app called Task Mate using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. It supports search and filter features by title, description, or category. Tasks are saved in local storage for persistence, and a reminder system alerts users about unfinished or overdue tasks every minute, including a sound notification.
